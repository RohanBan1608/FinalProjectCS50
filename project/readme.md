This website is a fully functional online store that allows users to browse gaming items from the comfort of their own homes.

This is a menu-based website developed using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
It is a website that allows you to browse gaming items.

There are about 18 products each having a category to which each of them belongs.

This is a gaming store website built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The website is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for gamers to purchase their favorite gaming items online.

The homepage features all of the, as well as a menu and some buttons regarding the different categories of gaming items.

The website is responsive and can be accessed on desktop or mobile devices.

The Gaming Store Website has a variety of features that make it easy for users to browse the 
various gaming items such as:
1) Homepage: The homepage contains all of the gaming items that are available within the store.
2) Menu Buttons: The website contains several buttons eg: Consoles, Keyboard, Mouse etc that filters
the items within the store based on the clicked category.
3) FAQ page: The website also contains a FAQ page that contains few of the users' most asked questions. It also has a dark mode button that can switch between the dark mode and the light mode.
4) Code structure: The code is divided into three languages:
a) HTML: The HTML part of the code at the beginning contains some meta definitions for responsiveness. It also contains several div's and sections for better organization of items on the
website. The HTML has links to two files: main.css and app.js. The HTML also has a link to "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/darkmode-js@1.5.7/lib/darkmode-js.min.js" which is the requirement for enabling dark mode on the website. It also has a form button that is responsible for leading to the FAQ page. This HTML is contained within the file "index.html".
b) CSS: The CSS part of the code deals with styling the website and its contents. First, in CSS we import some google fonts. Then we define some primary and secondary colours. The rest of the part of the code deals with
styling the elements of the page and keeping them in their proper positions.
The CSS part is located within the file "main.css"
c) Javascript: The Javascript part of the code firstly contains the menu array that stores all of our product id, the title, their category, their price, their description and then their respective images. Our website has a total of 18 products. The function "displayMenuItems() takes in a menu as an argument.It then displays the image, title and all other attributes of each product by using the map() function. The function displayMenuButtons() deals with displaying the categories of all the products in a responsive way such that each button of every category can be easily renamed and more categories can be added. The filterBtns function filters all of the products according to their categories when the respective category button is clicked. This Javascript is located in the "app.js" file.
All the files for the FAQ page is located inside the "templates" folder.
All the images used in this website is located inside the "images" folder.

5) CS50: Going to thank all of those at CS50 for encouraging me to code more and making me confident in coding by myself. The problem sets were tough and enabled me to think more and more out of the box. It was a wonderful experience and I completed this course "CS50's Introduction To Computer Science: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=a76d34be5ce98ff1c38d7e4a6cde6a0f&position=1&v=1&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete " in about 6 months.
